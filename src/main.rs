/// dataset provided by the National Hurricane Center. In particular,
/// we print a table consisting of all hurricanes that landed in Florida,
/// the date and time that landfall occurred, and an estimate of the

/// This application also attempts to parallelize everything that can
/// be parallelized, which informs many of the design choices made
/// below.

/// After installation, this application can be run from the command line, e.g.,
